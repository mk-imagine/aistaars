Wow Crust is not good.,0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.,0
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.,0
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.,0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.,0
Would not go back.,0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.,0
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.,0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.,0
Waitress was a little slow in service.,0
did not like at all.,0
The Burrittos Blah!,0
The worst was the salmon sashimi.,0
This was like the final blow!,0
Service sucks.,0
The turkey and roast beef were bland.,0
The pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old.,0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.,0
say bye bye to your tip lady!,0
We'll never go again.,0
